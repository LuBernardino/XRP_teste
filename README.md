**Frontend Test Project - Login Page**

This project was developed as part of a frontend test for a job position. The goal was to create a simple login page using HTML, SCSS, and Javascript. The developed screen aims to replace the original screen provided in the test scope.

### Technologies Used

- HTML
- SCSS (CSS Superset)
- Javascript
- Figma

### About SCSS

SCSS is a CSS superset that adds extra features such as variables, mixins, inheritance, and operators. This language is widely used in conjunction with frameworks and libraries. In this test, the Live Sass Compiler extension for VSCode was used to transpile SCSS to CSS since browsers only recognize CSS. The project includes the CSS file generated from SCSS.

### Design

The interface design was created using the Figma tool. [Click here](https://www.figma.com/file/Wjec0xCaEyyobIn4DW9GR9/XRP_teste?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=mG3jdSK3gjO0tWFq-1) to view the prototype.

### Execution Instructions

To view the login page, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

### Final Considerations

This project aims to meet the test requirements, providing a functional solution that aligns aesthetically with the provided design.
