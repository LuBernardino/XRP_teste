## Frontend Test Project - Login Page

This project was developed as part of a frontend test for a job position. The goal was to create a simple login page using HTML, SCSS, and Javascript. The developed screen aims to replace the original screen provided in the test scope.

### Technologies Used

- HTML
- SCSS (CSS Superset)
- Javascript
- Figma

### About SCSS

SCSS is a CSS superset that adds extra features such as variables, mixins, inheritance, and operators. This language is widely used in conjunction with frameworks and libraries. In this test, the Live Sass Compiler extension for VSCode was used to transpile SCSS to CSS since browsers only recognize CSS. The project includes the CSS file generated from SCSS.

The interface design was created using the Figma tool. [Click here](https://www.figma.com/file/Wjec0xCaEyyobIn4DW9GR9/XRP_teste?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=mG3jdSK3gjO0tWFq-1) to view the prototype.
